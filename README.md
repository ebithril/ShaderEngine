# ShaderEngine

This will become 3D renderer based on DX11 right now only the base is done with initing D3D11 and a working backbuffer. the plan is that the engine should be pretty easy to change it to using OpenGL, Vulkan, or DX12.
The project is a base right now where the base is laid things like setting render target and create GPU resources is handled by
the DirectX class.

The engine is being built for fixing some shader assignments in school.

#How to build

I know the project can be built with Visual Studio 2013 Community and Professional edition.
